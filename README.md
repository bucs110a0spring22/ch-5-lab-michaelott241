## SUMMARY:
What did you clean up?:
I cleaned up the lab, fixing errors from my previous submission (the dart landing inside the circle is now a different color than outside and the dart marks are cleared after Part B) and tried to consolidate the code to the best of my ability, though I found that to my knowledge, most of it was necessary. 

Summary of function(s) added:
def modifiedDarts was my added function, which allowed me to simulate a 2 Person Traditional Dart Game with a modern twist, while having parameters and returning a value. 

Summary of Feature Added:
The feature I added was a simulation of an actual game of Darts between two players. I did so by alotting each quadrant a specific numerical point value, going from 5, 10, 15 and 20. In darts, opponents must compete for who could land at exactly zero or else they "bust" and must return to their score from the previous round. I wanted to recreate the classic game but with a twist...if you bust, you must reset from 100! I thought this was a fun way to make a comeback possible and raise the stakes. 

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS:
While I was able to remove the dots from part B to C, I was not able to figure out how to get rid of the turtles on screen without throwing off the code.
